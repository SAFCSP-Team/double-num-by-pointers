# Double Number by Pointers

### Objective

In this project, our main goal is to understand how to use pointers in C++.

### Problem

Develop a function `doubleNum` that accepts and doubles an integer. Then print the value in the main method.

### Implementation
- Create `doubleNum` function.
- In the `main` function, create a variable `num` to pass it later to `doubleNum`.
- Call the `doubleNum` function from the main method.
- Print the value of `num` in the main method.
  
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    /* Your code here*/
    return 0;
}

```
